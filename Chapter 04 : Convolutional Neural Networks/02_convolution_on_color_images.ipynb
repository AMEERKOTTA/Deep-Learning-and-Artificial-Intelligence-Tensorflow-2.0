        "+ Images are 3D Objects - `[height x width x color]`\n",
        "+ Previously we defined convolution for 2D (grayscale) images and Corresponding 2D filters.\n",
        "+ So, Extending this to Color Images by Saying the filter should just have the same depth, then we dot along all 3 axes.\n",
        "+ This breaks the Uniformity, because input is 3D and output is 2D.\n",
        "+ So, we wouldn't be able to stack multiple convolutions sequentially.\n",
        "+ Then we extended this further by noting that each layer should find multiple features. (using multiple filters)\n",
        "+ This results in multiple 2D outputs (one per filter) which we can stack to get a 3D image once again.\n",

        "+ So, the 3rd dimension is not necessirily the Color Channel.\n",
        "+ So, we call these Feature Maps.\n",
        "+ e.g :- each 2D image is a Map that tells us where the feature is found.\n",
