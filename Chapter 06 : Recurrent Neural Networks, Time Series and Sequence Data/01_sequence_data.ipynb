        "\n",
        "+ Deep Learning Originally become Popular due to its Impressive ability to work with Images.\n",
        "+ Since then, it has also dominated Sequence Data as well.\n",
        "+ Example :- Text, Speech, Financial / Stock Returns, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIME SERIES\n",
        "\n",
        "+ This is what People usually think of when asked to think of a Sequence.\n",
        "+ `Any Continuous Valued Measurements.`\n",
        "+ Example :- A company's stock price.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Example : AIRLINE PASSENGERS**\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Data of Airline Passengers is a Time Series Data.\n",
        "+ Forecasting this would be very Useful.\n",
        "+ To Make Sure the Airport has enough workers to handle the Passengers.\n",
        "+ To Modify the Prices to reflect demand.\n",
        "+ To Decide where to Spend Resources and Marketing etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Example : WEATHER FORECASTING**\n",
        "\n",
        "+ We all make use of this on a Regular basis.\n",
        "+ Weather is a Dynamic System.\n",
        "+ See Chaos Theory and Butterfly Effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example : SPEECH / AUDIO**\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Application :- Speech Recognition.\n",
        "+ If you do any Audio or Music Production, you are looking at Sound Waves all the Time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Example :- TEXT DATA**\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Another area where deep learning Excels.\n",
        "+ We don't have to treat text as a Sequence.\n",
        "+ In the Olden Days of ML, we would use bag-of-words feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "BAG OF WORDS \n",
        "\n",
        "+ Suppose you are Doing Document Classification.\n",
        "+ like Classifying Email to Spam and Non Spam.\n",
        "+ Then Create a Big Long Feature Vector.\n",
        "+ One Entry for Each Word in the English Language.\n",
        "+ Inside the Vector, We insert the Count of how many times each word appeared in the Email.\n",
        "\n",
        "EXAMPLE OF BAG OF WORDS\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Suppose there are Only 5 Words in English Language.\n",
        "+ [insurance, loan, pickles, backpack, football]\n",
        "+ Lets say the Email Contains `\"insurance\" 3 times, \"loan\" 1 time, and other words 0 times`.\n",
        "+ then the feature vector would be,\n",
        "  `[3,1,0,0,0]`\n",
        "\n",
        "PROBLEM WITH BAG OF WORDS\n",
        "\n",
        "+ When we only count each word, we lose information about each order of the Words.\n",
        "+ Example \"Dog Toy\" and \"Toy Dog\"\n",
        "+ One is a Toy for Dogs.\n",
        "+ And the Other is Toy that look like Dog.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "WHAT IS A SEQUENCE DATA?\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Usually we think of a 1D time series Signal.\n",
        "+ Just like how when we started with Linear Regression, we imagined a line of best fit.\n",
        "+ Just like with Linear Regression we can Extend the Concept with Multiple Dimensions.\n",
        "+ For non sequential data, we have NxD matrix.\n",
        "+ Even if D = 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "HOW DO WE DEFINE THE SHAPE OF TEH SEQUENCE?\n",
        "\n",
        "+ How do we represent the Length of the Sequence.\n",
        "+ Is it N?, or Is it D?\n",
        "+ Lets use new Letter T as Length of the Sequence.\n",
        "+ So the Sequence is of Shape (NxTxD)\n",
        "+ N - number of samples.\n",
        "+ T - number of steps in the Sequence.\n",
        "+ D - number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "EXAMPLE : LOCATION DATA\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Suppose we want to build a model to predict the path Employees take to get to work.\n",
        "+ Record GPS data from their Cars.\n",
        "+ Here N : One sample would be one person's Single trip to Work.\n",
        "+ the dataset may contain multiple trips for the same person.\n",
        "+ D : 2, is (latitude and longitude)\n",
        "+ T : the number of (lat, long) measurements taken from start to finish the single trip.\n",
        "+ ie, trip is 30 minutes, cordinates measured every second.\n",
        "+ then 30 x 60 = 1800.\n",
        "+ Wouldn't each person take different amount of time to get to work.?\n",
        "+ In tensorflow/keras we deal only with the equal length sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "EXAMPLE : STOCK PRICE\n",
        "\n",
        "+ A Stock Price is just a Single Value, So D = 1.\n",
        "+ A Simple Example, Suppose we use a Window of size T = 10, to predict the next value.\n",
        "+ then N = number of Windows.\n",
        "+ If we have Sequnce of 100 Stocks.\n",
        "+ How many windows of length 10 are there.\n",
        "+ ie, 100 - 10 + 1 = 91\n",
        "+ ie equation = L - T + 1\n",
        "+ What if we measure the stock price every day for 500 different stocks.\n",
        "+ then D = 500.\n",
        "+ We can still look at the window of length T = 10.\n",
        "+ Then Single Sample will be of Size TxD = 10x500.\n",
